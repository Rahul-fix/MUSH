# MUSH (Model Uncertainty Sensitivity to Hyperparameters)

Exploring the Sensitivity of Model Uncertainty to Hyperparameter Variations: A Systematic Analysis

## Structure
- `src/` - Source code (data, models, training, utils)
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `data/` - Raw and processed data (not tracked by git)
- `logs/` - Training logs
- `outputs/` - Model checkpoints, predictions
- `mlruns/` - MLflow experiment tracking
- `scripts/` - Standalone scripts
- `tests/` - Unit tests

## Setup
See `environment.yml` for dependencies.

## Usage
- Use Jupyter notebooks in `notebooks/` for experiments.
- Place source code in `src/`.
- Use `mlruns/` for MLflow tracking.
